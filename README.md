# Code for "Annotated Hypergraphs: Models and Applications" 

This repository contains code accompanying the paper "Annotated Hypergraphs: Models and Applications" by Phil Chodrow and Andy Mellor, available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01331). 

This repository implements an `annotated_hypergraph()` class, the primary purpose of which is Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling from the null distribution described in the paper. It also implements the observables and algorithms described in that paper. 

The best way to learn how to use the `annotated_hypergraph()` class is by inspection of `demo.ipynb`.
